<p>Recently I came across a really interesting fact about the common seasquirt.
This peculiar creature lives its life in two very different phases.</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s born, it quickly develops from egg into a tadpole-like creature.
It has a simple eye and a tail to swim about. It even has a spinal cord and a primitive brain to control it&rsquo;s movement.</p>

<p>The seasquirt swims with a purpose: it is looking for a home where it will spend the rest of its life.
So, when it finally finds a rock (or boat) that it likes, it latches on to it and the second phase of its life begins.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s where things get really interesting. Once it has found a home, the seasquirt starts <strong>eating its own brain</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.
Being permanently attached to a home makes the need for a brain superfluous, so its body digests it for the protein that it provides and then keeps on living for decades without a brain.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-means-for-us">What this means for us<a href="#what-this-means-for-us" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2>

<p>The seasquirt, a distant relative to humans,  gives us some insight about what the brain evolved to do: its original funciton is strictly related to movement.</p>

<p>In fact, recent studies suggest that physical activity increases the white matter microstructure in our brain<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
This white matter is responsible for fast and efficient communication between different brain regions.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s pause and think about this for a moment.
In modern society, children and adults are more and more encouraged to spend big part of their day sitting at a desk.
And when we have free time at the end of the day we often find ourselves captured by a screen.
These stationary behaviours have a negative effect on our brain development<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>, so we should actively try to avoid them.</p>

<p>Adjustable-height desks are a very productive solution to the work-related problems, but not all can afford that.
Ideally one should try and be more active.
Even something as simple as setting up a reminder to stand up and walk about every so often can make a difference.
In fact, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m about to do, together with abruptly ending this blog post.</p>

Food for thought, how to people in the modern world sit still for hours and hours during the day.

The seasquirt is a sponge like creature that when it's born it's a sort of tadpole with an eye and a tail and it uses them to swim around and find a home where it will live the rest of its life.
Whatever rock (or boat) it chooses it then latches on and stays there forever.
But interestingly, once it find a home, it eats its own brain. This happens because once it has found a home it no longer need a brain for moving about.
So it absorbs it for the protein that it provides and lives for decades with no brain at all.
